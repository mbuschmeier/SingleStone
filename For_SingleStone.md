SingleStone, 

I look forward to reviewing the project with your engineering team, as well as answering any questions as to my design and scope decisions.
In the interest of time I intentionally left out comprehensive logging, a full and robust validation system. However, there are hints as to where those would be implemented.

To build the project simply run:

<b>gradlew bootRun</b>

in the command prompt.
