SingleStone, 

I look forward to reviewing the project with your engineering team, as well as answering any questions as to my design and scope decisions.

A few of my decisions on the scope of this project:

In the interest of time I intentionally left out comprehensive logging, a full and robust validation system, and full coverage of unit tests (I'm sure I could add 10-15 more). However, there are hints as to where and how those would be implemented.

I used an H2 embedded database, there should be no setup required.

To build the project simply run:

<b>gradlew bootRun</b>

in the command prompt.
